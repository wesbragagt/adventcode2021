# Advent of code 2021

Aiming for those 50 stars while practicing two paradigms, OOP and functional programming for each solution. Using typescript.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies 
```sh 
yarn
``` 

```sh 
npm install
```

2. Create a .env file and paste your cookie session

```sh
COOKIE=<paste just the value of your cookie session after you login in the site>
```

3. You are ready to roll! Simply run 

```sh 
yarn solve or npm run solve <folder of the challenge or specific file>
```
and see the output of the challenge.
